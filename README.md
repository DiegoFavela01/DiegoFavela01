## PROJECTS

### [S&P 500 Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/DiegoFavela01/Portfolio_Optimizer)

The S&P 500 Portfolio Optimization project showcases an advanced strategy that harnesses extensive historical stock performance data to create an efficient and dynamic portfolio. This project uses a neural network model to maximize returns while managing risk effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Developed a neural network model to analyze historical stock data and forecast potential returns.
- Utilized Efficient Frontier optimization techniques to calculate the most optimal portfolio weights for individual stocks, with a primary focus on maximizing the Sharpe ratio.
- Implemented a dynamic allocation strategy, allowing the portfolio to adapt to changing market conditions.
- Employed robust risk management measures to maintain portfolio stability while aligning volatility levels with the S&P 500 index, safeguarding against excessive risk exposure.
- Backtested the strategy using historical data to assess its performance over different market cycles.

### [Machine Learning S&P 500 Price Prediction](https://github.com/DiegoFavela01/Stock_Predictor)

The Machine Learning S&P 500 Price Prediction project aims to forecast future price movements of the S&P 500 index by analyzing various data sources and utilizing machine learning algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Developed and trained a neural network model to predict future price movements based on a combination of technical indicators, historical price data, and sentiment scores from social media platforms.
- Utilized k-means clustering to categorize historical VIX (Volatility Index) data into "low," "medium," and "high" volatility levels for the S&P 500, aiding in better risk assessment.
- Extracted essential technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and other market indicators from historical S&P 500 data.
- Conducted sentiment analysis on real-time Twitter data to assess market sentiment related to the S&P 500, enabling the incorporation of investor sentiment as a factor in the price prediction model.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and fine-tuned its hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

### [Stock Investment Analysis Application](https://github.com/DiegoFavela01/Stock_Analysis_Recommendations)

The Stock Investment Analysis Application provides investors with comprehensive tools and analyses to aid their decision-making when investing in individual stocks.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented a Bollinger Band graph, which helps investors assess recent volatility in the stock's price movements, assisting in identifying potential price breakouts or reversals.
- Conducted a performance check using a Python Monte Carlo Simulation, simulating thousands of possible market scenarios to estimate the stock's expected performance and potential risks.
- Utilized the application to run a Sharpe and Sortino Ratio analysis on the selected stocks, providing insights into risk-adjusted returns and downside risk, aiding investors in making more informed choices.
- Incorporated historical price data and technical indicators to generate interactive charts, enabling users to visualize a stock's performance and identify key trends.
- Delivered a final Buy/Sell/Hold recommendation based on the comprehensive analysis, providing clear guidance to investors regarding whether to initiate, hold, or divest from the selected stocks.
